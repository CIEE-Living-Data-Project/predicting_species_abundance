This folder stores the `collated_pairs.RData` file, which is created using the `scripts/prep_biotime/data_processing.R` script. This is the main data file used in the analysis. It contains the abundance and biomass data for each species found at each site/study ID.\
See `_DATA-DICTIONARY.md` for descriptions of column names.
