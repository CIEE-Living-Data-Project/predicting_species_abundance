**Description of: `between.studies.overlap.RDS`:** This RDS file is a spreadsheet containing information about genus pairs and the amount of years (observations?) they overlap between studies. Genus names are aggregated from species-level observations

| Column Name | Description                                                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Gn1         | Genus 1 of pair                                                                 |
| Gn2         | Genus 2 of pair                                                                 |
| Max.Overlap | Maximum number of overlapping observations per pair                             |
| Type        | Between versus within study pairs, this table contains only between study pairs |
| PAIR.ID     | Unique pair ID, (Gn1 study ID - Gn2 study ID)                                   |
