This directory stores the raw data downloaded from BioTIME by Nathalie Chardon on 15 Mar 2023.\
The data are stored as both `.csv` and `.RData` files. The `bio_pairs_1km.*` and `bio_pairs_10km.*` datasets are the records of overlapping species time series at 1km and 10km resolutions, respectively. The `meta_pairs_10km.*` data have the metadata for each study ID found in the `bio_pairs_10km.*` data file.\
See `_DATA-DICTIONARY.md` for column descriptions.
