**Before the start of the working group**, we'd like you to:
- make sure you have git installed
- create a GitHub account
- configure git so that it links to you GitHub account
- create and store a Personal Access Token
- practice commits, pushes, and pulls

The following tutorial will help walk you through each of these steps! Please attend our office hours, or contact us directly, if you need help with any of these steps.

### Install Git on your computer

There are several options for installing git on your own computer. Github has a handy [installation guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) on their website, and [this guide](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) has some helpful additional instructions.

To check if you already have git installed, open up your terminal or command line and enter `git version`

Many (but not all!) of the options for installation are command line based, which can be intimidating if you're not used to it. If you encounter any issues installing git, please contact Sam Straus at [samantha.straus\@mcgill.ca](mailto:samantha.straus@mcgill.ca){.email}.

#### Configure git

We're demonstrating an approach to configuring your git account using Rstudio, but there is also a very simple command line approach you can [follow here](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html), if you wish.

To do this in Rstudio with the `usethis` package:

`{r} use_git_config(user.name = "your name", user.email = "name@email.org")`


### Configure your Github credentials

By this point, you have created your Github account and installed Git in your computer. These next steps allow your local computer to communicate with your remote Github account.

#### Creating and storing your Personal Access Token (PAT)

GitHub uses Personal Access Tokens (or PATs) in place of passwords for security reasons.

If you want to read more about why GitHub made this change, you can check out [this blog post](https://github.blog/2020-07-30-token-authentication-requirements-for-api-and-git-operations/#background).

**Here, we give you some guidance on how to practically deal with creating and storing PATs.**

The instructions we provide here are for setting up PATs in R/RStudio, but you can do all of these tasks outside of R using GitHub and the command line. For additional alternatives (both in and out of R), check out the chapter on PATs in [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html?q=personal%20acces#https-pat).

First, install the `usethis` package, if you haven't already:

`install.packages("usethis")`

Next, run the following line of code:

`usethis::create_github_token()`

This will open GitHub at the PAT page. Follow [the instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and click "Generate Token." Copy the access token that has been generated.

**Use Rstudio to save your PAT** To save your PAT so you don't have to enter it over and over again, run the following using the `gitcreds` package:

`gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

When asked to do so, paste your PAT and hit enter. You can also check your saved PAT using `gitcreds::gitcreds_get()`

Voila! Your PAT is stored, and you may go about pulling and pushing as you please!
