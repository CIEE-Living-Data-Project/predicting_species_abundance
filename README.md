This project synthesizes data from two large, global datasets: BioTIME and GloBI to quantify pairwise relationships in biodiversity through time and space. It contains four main subdirectories:

-   `data/` contains the raw data (downloaded from BioTIME on 15 March 2023) and the processed data used for analysis

-   `figures/` contains exploratory and final figures created in analyses

-   `scripts/` contains scripts used in pre-processing and to create the pre-working group homework assignment

- `outputs/` contains model outputs of the Bayesian regression models
