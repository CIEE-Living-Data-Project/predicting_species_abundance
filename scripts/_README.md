This directory stores the scripts used in the data processing and analysis for the working group. There are two subdirectories:

-   `analysis_Q1/` Code associated with Question 1 of our manuscripts

-   `analysis_Q2/` Code associated with Question 2 of our manuscripts

-   `data_processing/` Code associated with tidying and preparing our data for analysis

-   the `prep_biotime/` subdirectory stores the scripts used to download and pre-process the data

Additionally, the directory contains the following files:

-   `Manuscript_figures.R` - an R script to generate figures presented in the mansucript

-   `Pipeline_code.Rmd`- and Rmarkdown script that calls other R scripts used in data processing and analysis, with detailed descriptions of steps followed during the analysis
