This directory stores the scripts used to download and process the data, along with some basic data explorations.

-   The `correlations_distributions.R` script is used to create exploratory figures of the distributions of correlations between habitat types, taxa pairs, and combinations of both. Figures are stored in the `figures/explore_biottime_Dec2022` directory.

-   The `data_processing.R` script is used to clean and collate the data; this script creates the `data/tidy/collated.pairs.RData` file.

-   The `download_data.R` script outlines the process of downloading the data from BioTIME. The last query occurred on 15 March 2023 by Nathalie Chardon. \\

-   The `explore_biotime.R` script includes code for some preliminary data exploration of the dataset, including some exploratory figures that save to the `figures/explore_biottime_Dec2022` directory.
