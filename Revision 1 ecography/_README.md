This directory stores the scripts used in the data processing and analysis for the working group. There are three sub directories:

-   `output/` This is a folder with subdirectories that organizes the output of scripts--intermediate data steps, figures, and model objects

-   `raw biotime data` raw data downloaded from biotime that are used in this analysis (note too large to push to github)

-   `scripts/` This folder has subdirectories that organize all the scripts used in this analysis, data curation/cleaning, modelling, figure creation
