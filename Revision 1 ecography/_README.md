This directory stores the final scripts used in the data processing and analysis for the working group after mansuscript revision and review. There are three sub directories:

-   `output/` This is a folder with sub-directories that organizes the output of scripts--intermediate data steps, figures, and model objects

-   `raw biotime data` contains the raw data downloaded from BioTime that are used in this analysis (note too large to push to github and must be downloaded separately)

-   `scripts/` This folder contains has sub directories that organize all the scripts used in this analysis, data curation, cleaning, modelling, and figure creation
