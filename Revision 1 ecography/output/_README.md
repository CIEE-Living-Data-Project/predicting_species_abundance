This directory stores the outputs created by the data processing and analysis for the working group. There are three sub directories:

-   `figures/` This folder stores the final figures and tables that are the direct output of analysis scripts. Therefore they are not the final published version that have been edited in illustrator (eg to contain labels etc) nor does this folder contain the conceptual figures. 

-   `models` This folder stores the saved model objects

-   `prep_data/` This folder stores the data that are created during the data cleaning and prep scripts
