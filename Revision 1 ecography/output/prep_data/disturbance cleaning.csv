The plot network extends from the coast to the Cascades in western Oregon and Washington and east to ponderosa pine forests in the Oregon Cascades. Most of the permanent plots were established during two intervals: from 1910 to 1948. and from 1970 to 1989. The earlier plots were established by U.S. Forest Service researchers to quantify timber growth in young stands of important commercial species and to help answer other applied forestry questions. The more recent period of plot establishment began under the Coniferous Forest Biome program of the International Biological Program during the 1970s. and continued under the Long-term Ecological Research program. A broader set of objectives motivated plot establishment since 1970. especially quantification of composition. structure. and population and ecosystem dynamics of natural forests. Plots have one of three spatial arrangements: (1) contiguous rectangles subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; (2) circular plots subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; and (3) circular plots systematically located on long transects to sample an entire watershed. ridge. or reserve. Rectangular study areas are mostly 1.0 ha or 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) in size (slope-corrected). Circular plots are 0.1 ha (0.247 ac). not corrected for slope. The tree stratum is the focus of work in closed-forest study areas. All trees larger than a minimum diameter (5 cm for most areas) are permanently tagged. Plots are censused every 5 or 6 years. Attributes measured or assessed at each census include tree diameter. tree vigor. and the condition of the crown and stem. The same attributes are recorded for trees (ingrowth) that have exceeded the minimum diameter since the previous census. In many plots tree locations are surveyed to provide a plot-specific x-y location. A mortality assessment is done for trees that have died since the previous census. The assessment characterizes rooting. stem. and crown condition. obvious signs of distress or disturbance. and the apparent predisposing and proximate causes of tree death. ____ Experimental Design - TV010: Description: The sites were selected subjectively to represent modal examples of the major habitat types in the H.J. Andrews area (usually with a mature and old growth example). Some stands (e.g.riparian) were selected for other reasons. The stands are remeasured at 5 to 10 year intervals to provide growth and regeneration information.Field Methods - TV010 : Description: The stands are surveyed into 25 X 25 slope corrected subplots marked with permanent stakes. All trees greater than the minimum size (usually 5 cm dbh) are tagged. diametered. vigor coded. and mapped. The mapping is done using a 5 X 5 m grid formed with string as a guide.

The 40 non-riparian sites are a subset of the 200 CAP- LTER points. We are using point counts to survey birds four times a year (January. April. July and October). During each session each point is visited by three birders who count all birds seen or heard for 15 minutes. Our goal is to study how different land-use forms affect bird abundance. distribution and diversity in the greater Phoenix area in order to predict and preserve high bird species diversity as urban development is proceeding. We have now just completed 3 years of monitoring. and are also beginning to see some of the sites changing due to new urban development. The results described below are based on analyses of the first two years? data. _______Bird Point Count Survey - GeneralA point count consists of one person standing in a specific location. for a fixed length of time. at a specific time of day. and counting all birds seen and heard within a specific distance (Fixed Radius.) or as far as the eye can see (Open Radius.)CAP-LTER uses 15-minute observation time spans.Counts are done within 4 hours of local sunrise.Counts are done using the Open Radius method.ADDITIONAL OBSERVERSThe primary observer may be accompanied to the plot area by an additional observer. However. only the primary observer should stand at plot center. and only the observations of the primary observer should be recorded on the data sheet. To avoid any bias that would invalidate the data collected. the secondary observer should not verbalize. point out birds. or give any non-verbal cues to the primary observer.Please note in the Notes column of the data sheet if an additional observer was present during the count.If the secondary observer sees something especially interesting that the primary observer did not see. it may be noted in the Notes column.COUNT CONDITIONSThe first point count should be started no earlier than local sunrise. The final point count should be finished no later than 4 hours past local sunrise.Do not conduct point counts in steady. or heavy rain. (It is okay to conduct counts in light. intermittent drizzle. but be sure to make note of this in the Weather line of the data sheet.)Do not conduct point counts in steady winds above 20 mph.APPROACHING THE PLOTApproach the plot as quietly as possible to minimize disturbance to the birds present.Make note in the Notes column of any birds flushed by the approach in case they do not return during the count.Stand quietly at plot center for 5 minutes before starting the count. This is essential to allow any disturbance caused by the approach to settle down.Use this 5-minute settle-down time to fill out the information at the top of the data sheet.Record in the Notes column any unusual circumstances around the plot. such as construction activity. or if a substantial part of the view is blocked. such as by a wall.CONDUCTING THE COUNTAfter the 5-minute settle-down period. set a watch or timer and conduct the count for 15 minutes. Rotate slowly in place and record all birds seen or heard. For each observation. note the following in the appropriate column of the data sheet.SpeciesUse the AOU code (7th Edition) if known. or write down the complete common name.If the species can not be positively identified. use the closest taxonomic affiliation. (It is better to record something as unknown rather than guessing.)Number of Individuals and DistanceUsually. a single individual bird will be recorded per line.Only record a number greater than one on a single line if birds of the same species are observed very close together. such as a flock or family group.If a mixed flock is observed. put each species on a separate line and note in the Notes column that they were part of a mixed flock.Record estimated flock sizes. only if you cannot count them all. in the following manner: 10-20 or 15+.Write the number of individuals observed in the appropriate distance columns (a meter - 39 inches - is a little bit longer than a yard.)If a bird moves during the count. record only the distance at which it was first observed.Try to be aware of bird movement to minimize counting birds twice.Fly-Throughs (FT)If a bird is seen flying through the count area. below the tallest structure or vegetation. but not observed taking off or landing. record it in the FT column only. not the distance columns. Note also the direction the bird was first observed.Higher flying birds can be noted in the Notes column if it is likely they are aerial screeners using the habitat. such as a hawk circling 100 feet overhead.You may note in the Notes column any unusual fly-overs. such as a flock of Sandhill Cranes.Seen (S) or Heard (H) ColumnsRecord with a check mark whether the bird was identified from sight or sound. or both. Use caution with similar-sounding birds. like Juncos and White-crowned Sparrows. or with mimics and imitators. like Grackles and Starlings.DirectionRecord the direction the bird was first observed. or heard. This may mean recording a bird heard to the south (S) even though you were facing northwest (N/W) at the time.Use the cardinal and midcardinal points of the compass (N. N/E. E. S/E. S. S/W. W. N/W) in this column.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONSWear drab clothing and avoid bold patterns that might scare away some birds. or attract other ones.Do not pish. squeak. or use any other methods to encourage birds to show themselves. This would artificially inflate the bird densities recorded and invalidate the data collected.If the 15-minute count is interrupted for more than 30 seconds for any reason. such as a homeowner coming up to ask what you are doing. make a note of the interruption in the Notes column. An interruption of 5 minutes or more should also be reflected in the End Time column.Do not start or continue a count if personal safety is threatened in any way.

Net primary production is a fundamental ecological variable that quantifies rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP are important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well as spatial and temporal responses to a range of ecological processes.Above-ground net primary production is the change in plant biomass represented by stems flowers fruit and and foliage over time and incoporates growth as well as loss to death and decomposition. To measure this change the vegetation variables in this dataset including species composition and the cover and height of individuals are sampled twice yearly (spring and fall) at permanent 1m x 1m plots within each site. A third sampling at Site C is performed in the winter. The data from these plots is used to build regressions correlating biomass and volume via weights of select harvested species obtained in SEV157 Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data. This biomass data is included in SEV182 Seasonal Biomass and Seasonal and Annual NPP for Core Research Sites.Methods: Locating the Sampling Quadrats: Site P the pinon-juniper woodland site (Cerro Montosa) is set-up differently than the other core sites. In order to accommodate the different habitat types groups of transects (i.e. plots) were set up along north (N) and south (S) facing slopes as well as along vegas (V) and ridges (R). Transects on the first two plots consist of 40 quads each (10 quadrants for each of four habitat types). Plot one is slightly west of plot three and plot two is slightly west of the weather station. Plot three is located on a wide piedmont which consists of four transects with five quadrats on each.Collecting the Data: Net primary production data is collected twice each year spring and fall for all sites. The Five Points Creosote Core Site is also sampled in winter. Spring measurements are taken in April or May when shrubs and spring annuals have reached peak biomass. Fall measurements are taken in either September or October when summer annuals have reached peak biomass but prior to killing frosts. Winter measurements are taken in February before the onset of spring growth.Vegetation data is collected on a palm top computer. A 1-m2 PVC-frame is placed over the fiberglass stakes that mark the diagonal corners of each quadrat. When measuring cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat to prevent errors caused by angle of view (parallax). Each PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string. The dimensions of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 percent of the total area.The cover (area) and height of each individual live (green) vegetative unit that falls within the one square meter quadrat is measured. A vegetative unit consists of an individual size class (as defined by a unique cover and height) of a particular species within a quadrat. Cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares filled by each vegetative unit.Niners and plexidecs are additional tools that help accurately determine the cover a vegetative unit. A niner is a small hand-held PVC frame that can be used to measure canopies. Like the larger PVC frame it is divided into 10cm x 10cm squares each square representing 1% of the total cover. However there are only nine squares within the frame hence the name ?niner.? A plexidec can help determine the cover of vegetative units with covers less than 1%. Plexidecs are clear plastic squares that are held above vegetation. Each plexidec represents a cover of 0.5% and has smaller dimensions etched onto the surface that correspond to 0.01% 0.05% 0.1% and 0.25% cover.It is extremely important that cover and height measurements remain consistent over time to ensure that regressions based on this data remain valid. Field crew members should calibrate with each other to ensure that observer bias does not influence data collection.Cover Measurements: Grasses-To determine the cover of a grass clump envision a perimeter around the central mass or densest portion of the plant excluding individual long leaves wispy ends or more open upper regions of the plant. Live foliage is frequently mixed with dead foliage in grass clumps and this must be kept in mind during measurement as our goal is to measure only plant biomass for the current season. In general recently dead foliage is yellow and dead foliage is gray. Within reason try to include only yellow or green portions of the plant in cover measurement while excluding portions of the plant that are gray. This is particularly important for measurements made in the winter when there is little or no green foliage present. In winter sometimes measurements will be based mainly on yellow foliage. Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a separate observation from the parent plant.Forbs shrubs and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-The cover of forbs shrubs and sub-shrubs is measured as the horizontal area of the plant. If the species is an annual it is acceptable to include the inflorescence in this measurement if it increases cover. If the species is a perennial do not include the inflorescence as part of the cover measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid measuring gray foliage that died in a previous season.Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha Opuntia imbricata) measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest cm instead of cover and height. Cacti that occur as a dense ball/clump of stems (Opuntia leptocaulis) are measured using the same protocol as shrubs. Pincushion or hedgehog cacti (Escobaria vivipara Schlerocactus intertextus Echinocereus fendleri) that occur as single (or clustered) cylindrical stems are measured as a single cover.Yuccas-Make separate observations for the leaves and caudex (thick basal stem). Break the observations into sections of leaves that are approximately the same height and record the cover as the perimeter around this group of leaf blades. The caudex is measured as a single cover. The thick leaves of yuccas make it difficult to make a cover measurement by centering yourself over the caudex of the plant. The cover of the caudex may be estimated by holding a niner next to it or using a tape measure to measure to approximate the area.Height Measurements: Height is recorded as a whole number in centimeters. All heights are vertical heights but they are not necessarily perpendicular to the ground if the ground is sloping.Annual grasses and all forbs-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the inflorescence (if present). Otherwise measure to the top of the green foliage.Perennial grasses-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the live green foliage. Do not include the inflorescence in the height measurement. The presence of live green foliage may be difficult to see in the winter. Check carefully at the base of the plant for the presence of green foliage. If none is found it may be necessary to pull the leaf sheaths off of several plants outside the quadrat. From this you may be able to make some observations about where green foliage is likely to occur.Perennial shrubs and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-Measure the height from the base of the green foliage to the top of the green foliage ignoring all bare stems. Do not measure to the ground unless the foliage reaches the ground.Plants rooted outside but hanging into a quadrat-Do not measure the height from the ground. Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat. Creosote Measurements: To measure creosote (i.e. Larrea tridenta) break the observations into two categories:1.) Small individual clusters of foliage on a branch (i.e. branch systems): Measure the horizontal cover of each live (i.e. green) foliage cluster ignoring small open spaces (keeping in mind the 15% guideline stated above). Then measure the vertical height of each cluster from the top of the foliage to a plane created by extending a line horizontally from the bottom of the foliage. Each individual foliage cluster within a bush is considered a separate observation.2.) Stems: Measure the length of each stem from the base to the beginning of live (i.e. green) foliage. Calculate the cumulative total of all stem measurements. This value is entered under height with the species as stem for each quadrat containing creosote. All other variable receive a default entry of 1 for creosote stem measurements.Do not measure dead stems or areas of dead foliage. If in doubt about whether a stem is alive scrape the stem with your fingernail and check for the presence of green cambium.Recording the Data: Excel spreadsheets are used for data entry and file names should begin with the overall study (npp) followed by the date (mm.dd.yy) and the initials of the recorder (.abc). Finally the site abbreviation should be added (i.e. c g b p). The final format for sites B G and C should be as follows: npp_core.mm.dd.yy.abc.xls. For site P the file format should be npp_pinj.mm.dd.yy.abc.xls. File names should be in lowercase.

Watershed 002d was ungrazed and burned every 2 years. Methods for the whole study are provided below and other watersheds are also available within BioTIME.
 
 Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per treatment. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
 Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.
 Grazed: N20B A:S-24, B:P-2; N01B A:S-25, B:P-23; N04D A:L-28, B:K-28; N04A A:G-25, B:F-26; N01A A:G-19, B:G-21; N20A A:G-20, B:E-19
 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

 Grazed: N20B A:S-24, B:P-2; N01B A:S-25, B:P-23; N04D A:L-28, B:K-28; N04A A:G-25, B:F-26; N01A A:G-19, B:G-21; N20A A:G-20, B:E-19
 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

Pitfall trap grids have been installed at three creosotebush sites. three grassland sites. and three mesquite sites. and two tarbush sites. Each grid consists of 4 x 4 rows of traps at 15 meter intervals. Each pitfall trap is 40 cm deep. and lined with tin can cylinders. A polyethylene funnel is set on a container in each trap. Each trap has a ceramic tile cover which is used to close the trap during non-sampling periods. Traps were opened for two consecutive weeks every month for the period 16 June 1989 to 23 August 1991. For the period post-August 1991. traps were opened for two consecutive weeks quarterly (Feb. May. Aug. Oct). During the summer traps are checked every three days. during the winter they are checked once each week. Lizards are removed from the containers and information is recorded on data sheets. Objectives. Desertification is hypothesized to have altered the spatial and temporal availability of resources required by the biota. Results of desertification on the Jornada include changes to shrub dominated communities and major soil changes. We hypothesize that these shifts in vegetation have changed resources temporally for many of the consumers. If grassland systems respond to rainfall without significant lags. but shrub systems do not. then consumer species should reflect these differences. In addition. shifts from grassland to shrubland results in greater structural heterogeneity of the habitats. We have hypothesized that consumer populations. diversity. and densities of some consumers will be higher in grasslands than in shrublands. Diversity and/or densities are hypothesized to be related to the NPP of the sites. Data will be collected for the duration of the LTER program in order to provide data to test these hypotheses.Protocol for Lizard Pitfalls - OVERVIEW.A grid of 16 pitfall traps is located at each consumer plot. Each trap is 40 cm deep and contains an inner plastic container and funnel. A ceramic tile is placed over each trap. For a 2-week period each sample period. the tiles are raised on one side. and the traps are checked every 3 days in summer and once a week in winter. Individual lizards are taken from the traps. identified. sexed. measured. and weighed. Each lizard was clipped with a unique number using the codes on the diagram on the field data sheets. Toe clipping was done from 1989 to 1995. Starting in March 1995 toe clipping was terminated and lizards were instead marked with a black sharpie marking pen to provide a temporary mark to determine recapture status over a particular 2-week trapping period. A black mark is made posterior to the cloaca on the ventral base of the tail. Trapping grid is a 4x4 with 15 meter interval between traps.I. INTRODUCTION. In conjunction with net primary production studies. consumer and faunal studies are conducted at or near NPP sites using pitfall traps. We use live traps. not employing ethylene glycol or other killing/preservative agents. with traps checked once a week at the minimum. Sampling-with-replacement is used with the lizards but without replacement for the arthropods; thus any released arthropods. when possible. should not be let go in the immediate vicinity of the pitfall grids (Note: separate pitfall traps for arthropods were established in 1995 for LTER-III).Lizard pitfall studies are conducted quarterly over a period of two weeks: in February-March (following winter NPP). in May-June (following spring NPP). in August. and in October-November (following fall NPP). A. LOCATION: Pitfall grids consist of sixteen stations (four rows of four traps) located at the following ll sites (the old code. no longer used. is given in parentheses following each site*): T-WEST (TBA). T-EAST (TBB). M-RABB-A (MDA). M-NORT (formerly M-RABB-C (MDC). moved to M-NORT in 1995). M-WELL (MDB). G-IBPE-C (GLC). G-SUMM (formerly G-IBPE-A (GLA). moved to G-SUMM in 1995) G-BASN (GLB). C-SAND-B (CBB). C-CALI (CBA). and C-GRAV (CBD). Pitfalls formerly located at MB (mixed basin slope NE of weather trailer) and C-SAND-C (CBC) have been closed. No pitfalls are directly associated with the following NPP sites: P-COLL. P-SMAL. P-TOBO (because of flooding potential). T-TAYL. or G-SUMM. The pitfall for C-SAND is located NW of the NPP site (see site map). The location of each trap is marked by a rebar bearing a numbered aluminum tag. * (old codes may still be found in data books and vial labels)B. CONSTRUCTION: The LTER pitfall traps are walled by two large vegetable cans. 6 diameter; size 10 tomato cans (6 lbs. 3 oz. ca. 6 l/2 high) are most common. The ends of the cans are cut out and the cans stacked so that the top of the upper can is nearly flush with the ground. Similar-sized coffee cans may be used; the funnel (see below) should fit the can with little excess space. The collection container is a slightly tapered plastic beverage cup 5 l/2 deep with top diameter of 4 l/2; several small (ca. l/16) holes are drilled in the bottom of each cup to facilitate drainage. A polypropylene funnel with top diameter of 5 l/2 is placed in the cup to seal the trap and prevent escapes; the stem and lower funnel are cut off about 4 below the top. making a lower hole of ca. l l/2- 1 3/4 diameter. The cups are supported on small stones or wooden blocks to raise the top of the funnel nearer the top of the can (it should not be flush); elevation of cups is especially important in poorly drained sites. When not in use. the traps are sealed by a ceramic tile with dirt packed along sides (see procedure below). Trap numbers (l-16) originally were stamped on a small aluminum block fastened to a rebar next to each pit. Many of these blocks are now missing. More recently. sites have been numbered with aluminum tags attached to the rebar. If both the block and tag are missing. the number can be determined by counting from the northeast corner of the grid (l-4 north-south. 5-8 next line south-north. etc.). However. some sites. notably BASN. have a different numbering scheme so always check adjacent trap numbers if unsure.A SITE MAP IS INCLUDED WITH THIS PROTOCOLII. PROCEDURE: Traps are usually opened on a Friday; the tiles are excavated and propped open l to 2 at one end using wooden blocks or stones. Be sure the tile covers the trap as completely as possible. During spring and summer. collections are made the Tuesday and Friday the week after opening and again Tuesday and Friday (close) of the next week. In fall and winter. collections on Fridays are sufficient. Take care to look under the cup; both lizards and arthropods (especially scorpions and crickets) will readily hide there. Any lizards found are carefully grasped (don't grab tail!) and subjected to the measurements detailed in section A below. Be sure to use forceps on venemous arthropods. Note special procedures for juvenile lizards. Before leaving for the field. make certain that you have the bag with measuring equipment (below) and a box with labelled cups (w/lids) for the eleven pitfall sites plus an additional unlabelled cup for each participant. The data book should be on a clipboard which has a list of lizard species codes and identification information affixed. IMPORTANT: the clipboard should also had an updated list of the identification numbers previously used in toe marking for the period prior to 1995. Equipment for processing lizards includes a metric ruler. scales. forceps. plastic bags. black sharpie markers. pencils. and a reptile field guide. The scale is a PESOLA (l00 gram) spring-type; it is expensive so should be kept out of the dirt. Equipment kept in a zippered bag either in FH 117 or 236. The following information is recorded in the Jornada LTER II Lizard Pitfall data book for each lizard:l. Pit number (see above).2. Species code: Lizard species are recorded using a four letter code (first two letters of generic and species names). Cnemidiphorus tigris is thus CNTI. etc.3. Sex: record an M. F. or J (juvenile) for each lizard. The field guide and clipboard information may assist in sexing. which differs in different families.4. Rec.: If individuals have been previously marked with a black.5. sharpie marker. record an R (recapture). Record an N for unmarked adults.6. Markings. Prior to 1995: Toe mark: For newly captured adults. toes are clipped according to the numbering system shown on each page of the data book. Note that the ventral side of the lizard is shown in the diagram. With scissors. clip the first 2 mm or so of the required toes. As lizards have only five toes. numbers 6-9 are not used in the codes. Upon reaching number 6 one should skip to the next availble combination (e.g. HOMA 2046 would skip to 2050; UTST 56 would skip to 100. Close attention should be given to avoid toe clipping errors. It is also imperative that accurate and updated records be kept (on provided clipboard sheet) of numbers used; be sure this sheet is brought to the field each time. Severe problems have occurred in the past with skipped and duplicated numbers. In general. JUVENILES. especially small ones. should not be toe clipped as the required handling may injure them. Put a dash across the toe mark space for small juveniles. After 1995: Each new lizard is marked with a back sharpie marker at the ventral base of the tail posterior to the cloaeca.7. S-V: record length (in mm) from snout apex to vent for each lizard. Exercise great care in handling juveniles for any measurements. Estimates might be better for very small juveniles; the handling needed to position the lizard for measurement may be injurious. If the juvenile is not too active it can be measured in the cup.8. Total length: record total length in mm from snout to tail tip for each lizard.9. Weight: place lizard in plastic bag and clip bag to the scale. Keeping bag out of wind if possible. note weight in grams (subtract bag weight) and record in data book. Very small to small juveniles can be estimated at l gram.10. Tail: record as whole (W) or broken (B). If tail is broken and regrown. record as broken and make a note at the bottom of the page. A SAMPLE LIZARD DATA BOOK PAGE IS INCLUDED WITH THIS PROTOCOL III. CLOSING PITFALLS: on the last day of collections. close the pitfalls by lowering the tiles to the ground surface and covering the pitfall as well as possible. and then packing soil or sand tightly around the edges and top of the tile. Soil on top may discourage coyotes and help assure tight closure. A shovel or trowel is useful in closing the traps. Be sure to place a stone atop the tile or it may be difficult to find the trap again. Sloppily closed pitfalls will be deathtraps for any organisms getting in. so take time to seal them.IV. GENERAL PROBLEMSl. Poor drainage (or flooding) is a problem in several areas. especially tarbush and BASN. If traps and cups are flooded. pour the cup onto a flat surface and try to recover as many organisms as possible (note in book any not kept). Using the cup. bail as much water out of the trap as possible.2. Broken tiles: this has been a problem at the RABB sites which are open to grazing. Tiles from the LTER I transect have been used as replacements. An extra tile is usually kept with the pitfall box and a box of tiles has been kept in the annex.3. Broken funnels: plastic funnels eventually begin to crack and must be replaced. If broken funnels are noticed make a note for immediate replacement. Some funnels are available in the FH236 lab.4. Natural toe loss in lizards may have affected the toe marking system. If new captures had lost toes (usually only one foot will be affected). attempts were made to incorporate the digit into the marking scheme. Toe losses in marked recaptures may be told by reference to the marking lists and should be noted in the data book. 5. Escapees: large. active lizards are easily capable of escaping from one's grip and occasionally from untended traps with the tile off. Beware of lizards running up your arm as you attempt to pull them from traps- a quick grab is safer than slow fishing. If a lizard escapes. note as much information as you can about it and then write escaped across the rest of the row.

The route included normal tallgrass prairie habitats. the shorelines of a pond. and intermittent streams. Amphibians and reptiles were detected by turning over rocks and other debris. and by sighting animals in the open. Each year. we recorded the number of individuals of each species encountered. and environmental conditions including: midday air temperature (C). water temperature (C). cloud cover. burn conditions (burned versus unburned). and the presence of flowing water in the intermittent streams (Table 1). ---- Fourteen herpetofaunal surveys were conducted during a 15-year period (1989‚Äì1990 and 1992‚Äì2003) at Bud Jan Nitschke (BJN) cattle ranch in Cowley County. Kansas (37u159 N. 96u439 W). The 650 ha ranch is located in the southern portion of the Flint Hills. and the vegetation is dominated by a matrix of perennial warm-season C4 grasses. such as big bluestem (A. gerardii). little bluestem (A. scoparius). indiangrass (S. nutans). and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). A diverse mixture of other less abundant species includes warm-season and cool-season grasses. composites. legumes. and other forbs. Woody species such as leadplant (Amorpha canescens). buckbrush (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). New Jersey tea (Caenothus herbaceous). and smooth sumac (Rhus glabra) are locally common (Freeman and Hulbert. 1985). Average monthly temperature ranges from a low in January (22.7 C) to a high in July (26.6 C). Average annual total precipitation ranges from .750 to 850 mm with 75% falling during a summer growing season (March‚ÄìJuly; Bark. 1987). One common characteristic of the region is protruding limestone outcrops on hilltops. which provide suitable habitat for several species of amphibians and reptiles. During the 15-year study. two management practices were implemented at the BJN ranch. Traditional season-long stocking (200 hundred cows with their calves. .0.6 animals/ha) was implemented the first 10 years (1989‚Äì1998) and pastures were burned in alternate years. Starting in 1999. the land management practice switched to intensive-early cattle stocking (approximately 650 yearlings. .1.0 animals/ha. maintained for 3 months starting in late spring) combined with annual burning.

Surveys were conducted between 04:30 and 08:00 EDT and most were completed by 06:30 EDT. Observers listened quietly for ten minutes at each of five stations. [In 2003 we increased the 5-species point count length from five to ten minutes in order to gather more information and to achieve methodological consistency with the all-species protocols and with Canada?s High-Elevation Landbird Program.]They recorded the number of each focal species seen or heard during three time periods: 0-3 minutes 3-5 minutes and 5-10 minutes. If Bicknell?s Thrush was not detected during or between point counts surveyors returned to each point immediately after the full route survey and broadcast a one-minute recording of the bird?s vocalizations in order to elicit a response from present but silent birds. A two-minute listening period followed each broadcast. [Prior to 2003 the broadcast duration was three minutes.]Audio playbacks were discontinued upon detection of one or more individuals. If no Bicknell?s Thrush responded to the broadcasts the status of the species at that location was classified as unknown. Monitors who completed their surveys without encountering Bicknell?sThrush were asked to conduct follow-up audio playback surveys at dusk or dawn before 15 July (after Atwood et al. 1996). If no observations of Bicknell?s Thrush were made during the second visit the species was presumed to be absent from that site. Site selection was based on a GIS model of potential Bicknell?s Thrush habitat that incorporates elevation. latitude. and forest type (see Lambert et al. 2005). The model depicts conifer-dominated forests above an elevation threshold that drops 81.63 m for every one-degree increase in latitude (-81.63 m/1? latitude). The threshold?s slope corresponds closely with the latitude-elevation relationship for treeline in the Appalachian Mountain chain. which is -83 m/1? latitude (Cogbill and White 1991). Four routes have been established on peaks lying below the elevation threshold. while forty routes cross the threshold due to the limited availability of trails or land area above the threshold. We made an attempt to randomize site selection by randomly assigning priority ranks to discrete units of high-elevation habitat. However. the choice of sites was constrained by the availability of volunteers and the location of existing trails. When placing routes. we favored discrete starting points (e.g. trail junction). extensive conifer stands. and upper elevations. Volunteers establishing a route for the first time placed five points at 200- to 250-m intervals along a mapped course. Monitors submitted a detailed description of each station in order to facilitate its location in future years. 10% quinaldine solution spread throughout the study site to anesthertize fish.

(1994) was applied also during the additional seventeen years. For a recent general description and discussion of the method we refer to Bibby et al. (2000). The method is also called spot mapping? after William (1936) and it is similar to the method used in the Common Bird Census in the UK (Marchant et al. 1990) and the Breeding Bird Census in North America (Robbins 1970). The observer walks slowly through the plot putting down all bird observations in their proper positions on a map paying particular attention to recording simultaneous presence of males in adjacent territories. Species maps are then constructed from the visit map records. The species maps are used to evaluate the number of distinct clusters of records which are believed to represent territories. The method is of course prone to errors both when recording the birds in the field and when evaluating the number of territories from the species maps. Furthermore the number of territories is never stable throughout the breeding season: some birds die some fail to breed successfully and leave their territories and some arrive late and establish new territories. However for our analysis it is not essential to know the exact number of territories in every particular part of every breeding season. Instead standardization (recording birds and evaluating the species maps in the same way every year) is the key to reliable comparisons and we did our best to achieve this. We made ten visits per year in all but two years (nine visits in 2007 and 2009). They were distributed from April through June (always after 9 April and before 18 June) but with variation according to the arrival of spring. All surveys were made by the same person one of the authors (Ann Mari Thorner). Since AMT also carried out all surveys in 1987?1992 there is now a series of no less than twenty-one years with the same observer. This ensures that the new results are comparable with the data from before 1993. Each visit took between two and three hours so the minimum annual survey effort was twenty hours. A cluster of records was accepted as a territory if it contained at least three records (for a few very late arriving species two records was considered sufficient; cf. Svensson 1978). Adjacent clusters were accepted as different territories either if they were distant enough from each other (in relation to typical territory size) to make it likely that they belonged to different males or if they contained simultaneous records (a male recorded in both at the same time). A special study on inter-specific competition with a large number of nest-boxes was conducted in the valley in 1963?1966 (Enemar et al. 1972). The populations of Great Tit Blue Tit and Pied Flycatcher were artificially enhanced these years. We removed the effect of the experiment by reducing the numbers to a proportion equal to the mean proportion in the four years before and the four years after the experiment. The number of Great Tits was reduced from 9 10 19 16 pairs to 6 6 12 10 respectively. The number of Blue Tits was reduced from 6 4 7 5 pairs to 3 2 4 3 pairs. The number of Pied Flycatchers was reduced from 15 18 18 13 pairs to 4 5 5 4 pairs. These modified values are used in all calculations in this paper. Species turnover rate between two different years was calculated by dividing the total of new and lost species with the number of species in year one plus the number of species in year two. This gives the value one hundred percent (that is complete) turnover when no species are common between the two compared years. This is different from the turnover calculation by Enemar et al. (1994) where the sum of new and lost species was divided by the mean number of species in the two years. The latter method gives one hundred percent turnover when half of the species have been lost and replaced with new ones (the methods are identical in principle but give results that differ by a factor of two). In the same way we calculated turnover between two years different number of years apart (from adjacent years to a maximum of fifty-six years apart that is 1953 and 2009). Altogether forty-one small passerine species were recorded as territorial in at least one of the fifty-seven years. Eighteen of these species were keeping territories in all or almost all years (the first eighteen species in Appendix 1 also listed in 33Table 1). These eighteen species are called regular? in this paper. The final twenty-three species of Appendix 1 that is those with zero values in many or almost all years are called non-regular species. Eight of these latter species were recorded in less than four of the fifty-seven years and these species are not at all tested for population change. For the remaining fifteen non-regular and the eighteen regular species we calculated and compared the average number of territories during the first forty and the last seventeen years respectively. The difference between the two periods for the regular species was tested using a two-tailed t-test (Microsoft Excel) and the logarithms of the original values (with a small number of zeros replaced with the value 0.1 to permit calculation of logarithms). The differences for the non-regular species were tested using frequencies namely the number of years with different number of territories (i.e. with 0 1 2 3 and so forth territories). When the number of frequency classes was larger than four frequencies were pooled to form exactly four classes the same ones for both periods giving a 2?4 cell matrix. The Fisher exact test was then applied using the Vassar Stats package (home page of Vassar College Poughkeepsee NY). For the regular species we also calculated the trends across all fifty-seven years using the logarithm of abundance and standard linear regression (Microsoft Excel) also here with zeros replaced with the value 0.1. The same method was used when we calculated trends for parts of the full time series in these species. When calculating correlations between species we used the Spearman rank correlation module of STATISTICA (version 6.1; StatSoft?).

Three 3.14-ha webs were established in each habitat. Each web had 124 Sherman traps which were spaced 10-m apart on 12 100-m spokes with 30 degrees between spokes.

Traps are baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats set in the evening and checked (and closed) at dawn. We recorded sex age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. In the early years of the study individuals were batch-marked (Sharpie colored felt markers) to distinguish recaptures from new individuals providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. Most nocturnal species are now usually marked with aluminum ear tags although we continue to mark very small (pocket mice) or small-eared (voles) species only with felt pens. For ear-tagged animals we distinguish new captures (N) from individuals marked during previous sessions (old O) versus those that are recaptured (R) on 2nd 3rd or 4th nights of a trapping session.

Traps are baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats set in the evening and checked (and closed) at dawn. We recorded sex age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. In the early years of the study individuals were batch-marked (Sharpie colored felt markers) to distinguish recaptures from new individuals providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. Most nocturnal species are now usually marked with aluminum ear tags although we continue to mark very small (pocket mice) or small-eared (voles) species only with felt pens. For ear-tagged animals we distinguish new captures (N) from individuals marked during previous sessions (old O) versus those that are recaptured (R) on 2nd 3rd or 4th nights of a trapping session. The location of one trapping web was changed from 13NE (1994-1997) to 13SW (1998- present) because of concerns about intensive cattle use in the pasture as well as activity of CPER Site Manager?s cats. bird abundance calculated from annual censuses on 4 similar transects and bird abundance per km^2 exprapolated from these counts Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",censuses,NA,rows with spp names of . or were removed.

Transects were similar in topography and representative of the total plantation. Birds on each transect were censused 9 times an equal number of times by each of 3 census takers. Total number of birds detected on the 8 ha of transects were extrapolated to number per km2 to facilitate comparison with other studies. Annual censuses by the same people were conducted during May each year from plantation age 2 (1977) through plantation age 17 (1992). All birds within a 40-m lateral distance from the transect mid-line detected by sight or sound were plotted on each transect map while each census taker slowly traversed the midline of each transect (Conner and Dickson 1980). Censusing of each transect took from 12 to 20 minutes; the extra time on some plots was used for identifying and recording birds. All censusing was completed within 3 hours after sunrise. Censusing was avoided during high winds (>19 kph) or substantial rain. Neotropical migratory bird abundance and bird species diversity were calculated for all transects each year. Bird species diversity was calculated from the information theory formula (MacArthur and MacArthur 1961).

This area was censused by the spot map method (Hall 1964) in 1947 (Stewart and Aldrich 1949). In 1948 the members of the Brooks Bird Club began a series of censuses by the spot-mapping method made in early June which have continued to the present at 5-year intervals (DeGarmo 1948 1953; Hall 1958; Hurley 1964; Koch 1968; DeGarmo and Koch 1974; Phillips 1979 1984). In 1959 a program of annual censuses by a rather different index method was begun. The method adopted has the merit of giving a satisfactory index of the number of territorial males in a minimum amount of time-one overnight trip to the area. The index method consists of traversing the length of the study area in a fairly rapid fashion tallying all the birds seen and heard during the traverse. This traverse requires about 12 min to complete. After a wait of about 3 min the area is traversed in the reverse direction. This down-and-back procedure is then repeated giving four traverses of the same route. One set of four is made during the last hour before dark (approximately 19:45-20: 45 EDT) and another set of four is made in the first hour of daylight the next morning (05: 30-06:30). After the evening counts a tentative judgment is made as to the probable number of singing males of each species on the area and at the end of the morning counts final judgment of the population is made. Counts of this nature have been made in the last 2 days of May or the first 2 days of June from 1959 through 1983. All counts through the years were made by the same observer. In the early years the index method counts were not too reliable while the method was being worked out but with added experience the later counts have been good measures of the population. In 1973 1978 and 1983 an additional index method count was made later in June to give some idea of the variation expected by this method. This comparison is given in Table 1. It is noted that most of the rarer species agree exactly but that some of the more numerous species differ by ? I male and the total population varies by ?2 males. In 1983 this variation in the Yellow-rumped Warbler and the Swainsons Thrush may have been due to the arrival of late migrants. In 1964 1968 1973 1978 and 1983 it was possible to compare the index method results with those of the more conventional spot-mapping method (see Tables 2 3 4). For species with small populations the two methods agree quite well but for the abundant species the index method appears to overestimate the population. This happens because this method makes no al- lowances for the fractions of certain territories being outside the boundaries of the study area. The difference is slight for individual species but the accumulated error in the total population is sometimes large. In 1983 when allowances were made for this effect the population estimates agreed almost exactly. The accuracy of the index method is highly sensitive to the weather. Inclement weather on the one day selected for the count can cause large errors. This is the apparent cause of the low count for 1967 made in a cold drizzle on the only 2-day period available that season. mark_recapture Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",mark_recapture,NA,The species were only given in common name so I changed them to the scientfic name There was no day or month provided FM biomass and depth given zeroes for NULL values,lat_long_year,NA

In brief a fixed-route walk (transect) is established at a site and butterflies are recorded along the route on a regular (weekly) basis under reasonable weather conditions for a number of years. Transect routes are chosen to sample evenly the habitat types and management activity on sites. Care is taken in choosing a transect route as it must then remain fixed to enable butterfly sightings to be compared from year to year. Transects are typically about 2-4km long taking between 45 minutes and two hours to walk and are divided into sections corresponding to different habitat or management units.Butterflies are recorded in a fixed width band (typically 5m wide) along the transect each week from the beginning of April until the end of September yielding ideally 26 counts per year. Transect walks are undertaken between 10.45am and 3.45pm and only when weather conditions are suitable for butterfly activity: dry conditions wind speed less than Beaufort scale 5 and temperature 13?C or greater if there is at least 60% sunshine or more than 17?C if overcast. Due to the vagaries of the British and Irish weather it is rare in practice to achieve a full set of 26 weekly counts. However a small number of missing values can be estimated using other counts during the season.Single species (as opposed to normal all species) transects have been increasingly established in recent years. Whilst such transects must follow the standard methodology and must record populations at least once a week throughout the flight period the focus on a single (or small number of) species reduces both the time required to walk each transect and more significantly the number of weekly counts. With many demands on the time of site management staff and volunteer recorders this reduced method has enabled population monitoring of particular threatened butterflies to be undertaken when otherwise it would not have been possible. By regularly recording a fixed route in standardised conditions the number of butterflies seen on a transect can be compared from year to year.

West Thornton. Grafton County. New Hampshire. USA. Our study took place on the 10-ha forest plot de- scribed by Holmes and Sturges (1975). which is located on a relatively steep (20-25%). south-southeast facing slope at an elevation of 500 to 600 m and adjacent to the lower third of watershed 6. the reference area for many of the Hubbard Brook ecosystem studies. The study plot was situated within a large tract of unfrag- mented and relatively homogeneous northern hard- woods forest. > 5 km distant from. and at an elevation 300 m above. the nearest human settlement. The only human-caused disturbances near the study area were on three experimental watersheds. 13. 10. and 22 ha in extent. which were logged by clear-cutting in 1967. in 1970. and from 1973 to 1975. respectively. The nearest of these was 0.6 km from the edge of our plot. the others were 1 and 2 km away. Although some for- est-dwelling birds moved to these areas in mid and late summer to feed on ripening fruit. we have no evidence that birds settling and breeding on the study area were in any way affected by these logged areas.Bird populations Bird censuses were conducted in a consistent manner in each of the 16 summers. These census methods have been described in detail by Holmes and Sturges (1975). Briefly. they involved: (1) Timed censuses. Two ob- servers moved at a rate of 50 m/6 min along parallel transect lines. 1 00 m apart. and recorded all birds heard or seen within 50 m on either side of the line. Since the 10-ha plot was 500 m long and 200 m wide and these lines ran 50 m in from the long sides. the entire plot was surveyed in a 1-h census. From these records. the numbers of individuals observed on the plot were then tallied. A minimum of two such censuses was conducted each week from late May through mid-July. (2) Territory-mapping. The positions of individual males (and females when seen). especially those en- gaged in simultaneous singing with neighbors. were plotted on a gridded census map. From these records. the territories of the males of many species could be delineated. (3) Mist-net captures. Forty to 50 mist nets. located at 50-m intervals on the census grid. were op- erated for 6-8 h/d. usually 1 or 2 d/wk from late May through early July in all years except 1980. Each cap- tured bird was given an aluminum band plus a unique combination of colored plastic bands. Capture and re- capture frequencies provided additional information on the presence of birds on the plot. including females and occasionally floaters. (4) Detailed observations. These provided information on nesting events and on the occurrence of females associated with males. Data from all methods were pooled and used to es- timate the total numbers of adult birds of each species living on the 1 0-ha study area during the breeding pe- riod. late May to early July. Final density estimates were adjusted for territories occurring only partly on the plot (i.e.. if a territory of a mated pair was half off the study area. only 0.5 male and 0.5 female for a total of one bird was counted) and for unmated males. The data therefore represent the total numbers of adult in- dividuals occupying 10 ha of northern hardwoods. For comparisons with most other studies. the numbers of individuals estimated to be on our plot should be di- vided in half to approximate the numbers of breeding pairs. These methods were most efficient for estimating the numbers of relatively small. mostly passerine birds that inhabit these forests. but also most woodpeckers and the one hummingbird species (see Table 2). We were unable to census adequately the raptors (Red-tailed Hawk. Buteo jamaicensis; Broad-winged Hawk. B. platypterus; Sharp-shinned Hawk. Accipiterstriatus; and Barred Owl. Strix varia). Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa um- bellus). Chimney Swift (Chaetura pelagica). and Pi- leated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus). which were present in this forest but ranged over an area much larger than our 10-ha plot. These low-density species are not included in our analyses. Insect Sampling We used two methods to estimate the abundance of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars). First. during periods of relatively high caterpillar densities (specifically sum- mers 1969 through 1973). we collected their fecal pel- lets (frass) falling from the forest canopy. Following the procedures of Gosz et al. (1973). we placed 20 funnels (each 20 cm in diameter) lined with filter paper and attached to 1 m tall stakes in a rectangular array on the census plot. with adjacent funnels 100 m apart. Frass was collected from the funnels at 2-4 d intervals. dried at 70'C for 48 h. and then weighed. Second. in 10 summers. caterpillars were censused directly on foliage by visually searching at least 80 50- leaf samples (i.e.. 4000 leaves and supporting petioles and twigs) at z2-wk intervals. For this paper. only data from caterpillar counts on beech foliage in the forest understory are presented. because (1) it was cen- sused in more seasons than any other type of foliage. (2) caterpillar abundance there was representative of that occurring on the foliage of other forest trees (R. T. Holmes and J. C. Schultz. personal observation). and analyses of the vertical distribution of caterpillars in this forest showed few if any differences in their abundance among the canopy. subcanopy. and sapling strata (J. C. Schultz and R. T. Holmes. personal ob- servation). Foliage profile measurements For recording changes in the vertical distribution of foliage. we measured the foliage density profile. using the method of MacArthur and Horn (1969). Six sep- arate vertical transects were made along a randomly placed sample line at each of 20 sites located 100 m apart on the study area. The measurements were av- eraged for each site. and then means and standard de- viations of foliage densities at each of seven vertical strata were obtained for the plot as a whole. Data were taken on the plot in 1972-1973 and again in 1982 at the same locations. Student's t tests were used to detect differences in foliage density within each stratum be- tween sampling periods.

Lockley. He took a lease on the island in October1927. and kept records of breeding birds from 1928 to1940 (Lockley 1938. 1947). After the war theobservatory was run by the West Wales Field Societyand the Council for the Promotion of Field Studies (nowthe Field Studies Council). and later by the EdwardGrey Institute of Field Ornithology of the University ofOxford. Records of breeding and. for most species inmost years. counts or estimates of the numbers ofbreeding pairs are available from 1928 to 1979. with abreak from 1941 to 1945. making 47 years of records.Those up to 1967 have been published by Lack (1969)and analysed by Williamson (1981). Those since 1967have been extracted from the Annual Reports of theObservatory in the Alexander Library of the EdwardGrey Institute. The whole record for land and waterbirds is given in Tab. 1.The criterion for inclusion in Tab. 1 is breeding. butas is now well recognised. there are different degrees ofcertainty in such records. For a study of immigrationand extinction the important question is whether a pairof birds was attempting to breed. rather than whether itbred successfully. For instance the raven Corvus coraxhad one pair every year (two in 1961). but in 1978built a nest in Steep Bay. but it remained empty. Inthe British Trust for Ornithology code this is B. Nestbuilding. and counts only as Probable breeding in thisspecies. though it is regarded as Confirmed breedingin most others (Sharrock 1976). For this study it countsas a population of one pair. In most cases the annualreport gives a single figure for the number of pairs. Forneighbouring integers. e.g. 12 or 13. I have taken thehigher figure. for ranges. e.g. 35 to 40. a figure at or just slightly from Lack (1969). and includes figures thatabove the mid-point (38 in this case). Lack records as question marks. and Lockley also givesFor the pre-war figures Lockley (1947) differs the figures for 1940. I have therefore taken histhroughout. rather than Lack's. The only importantdifference in relation to the MacArthur-Wilson theoryis that Lockley records one pair of sky lark Alauda arvensisin 1938. which Lack (and Williamson 1981) recordas an extinction followed by an immigration in1939. Lockley also notes that he shot or deported littleowls Athene noctua when he could. because they atestorm petrels Hydrobates pelagicus. so I have excludedlittle owls from Tab. 1.It is evident that many of the estimates of the commonbirds in Tab. 1 are round figures. In some yearsestimates are lacking. though breeding is recorded. andas a full set of figures is needed for the calculations thatfollow I have interpolated. approximately linearly. insuch cases. The interpolated figures are in italics in Tab.1.Skokholm is a most important station for sea-birdpopulations. Throughout the years there have beenthousands of pairs of Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus.storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus. and puffinsFratercula arctica. and these are the largest colonies.along with those on the neighbouring island of Skomer.in the Celtic Sea (Cramp et al. 1974). Herring gullsLarus argentatus and lesser black-backed gulls Larusfuscus have increased from hundreds of pairs pre-war tothousands now. There are also hundreds of pairs ofrazorbills Alca torda and guillemots Uria aalge. Thegreat black-backed gull Larus marinus population iscontrolled at around ten pairs. The fulmar Fulmarusglacialis first bred in 1967 and even now occupies lessthan twenty sites. There have been casual records ofbreeding of shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis and kittiwakeRissa tridactyla (Lockley 1969). There have also beenthirty to forty pairs of rock pipits Anthus spinolettabreeding on the cliffs each year. Lack (1969) did notregard them as land-birds. and I have. somewhat reluctantly.followed him. partly because the estimates ofpopulation size are even rougher than those of themeadow pipit A. pratensis.MethodsMany features of the data can be brought out by simplemethods (Williamson 1981). However. to produce asatisfactory ordination of both species and years is notso simple. and requires a consideration both of differentordination methods. and of whether the data should betransformed.For most biological populations a transformation tothe logarithm of the numbers is desirable (Williamson1972a). When there are many zeros. as in Tab. 1. log(n+1) or better the arc-sinh transformation. which islog (n+(n2+ 1)12). can be used (Williamson 1981). butthese small numbers show features of a Poisson distribution.s o a square root transformation may be desirable(Pollard 1977). Tukey (1977) gives methods fordetermining an appropriate power transformation.which he refers to as re-expression. (with the logarithmbeing equivalent to a zero power). It is well-known thata plot of the logarithm of the mean against thelogarithm of the variance may indicate that a transformation is needed. When the variance is proportional tothe mean. a square root transformation is indicated; thestandard deviation proportional to the mean indicates alogarithmic transformation. Taylor et al. (1978) givemany examples of such plots showing clearly. to mymind. that most biological data needs transformationand usually something. on Tukey's scale. bounded bythe square root and the logarithm.These tests on the data of years in Tab. 1. both includingand excluding zeros. point to a square roottransformation. By species. again with and withoutzeros. the results are more variable. which is not surprising.The raven population is almost constant at onepair. The stock dove Columba oenas and jackdaw Corvusmonedula populations vary from zero to sixty pairs.In view of this scatter.although a logarithmic transformationwould be better for the common species. asquare root transformation is justifiable for all. and sohas been used.A standard Principal Component Analysis of datawith many zeros usually produces a curved result. thehorseshoe effect. from artificial data designed to belinear (Williamson 1978). Various methods have beenproposed to prevent this including multi-dimensionalscaling. MDS (Carroll and Arabie 1980). reciprocal averaging(or contingency analysis). and Hill's developmentof it. Decorana (Gauch 1982). and the step-acrossmethod (Williamson 1978). Reciprocal averaging andstep-across are direct; multi-dimensional scaling isiterative. and requires a variety of starting configurations.Decorana assumes the second Principal axis to bean artefact. and reduces it by a slicing technique.Step-across applies only to incidence matrices. whereall the entries are one of zero. Much of the variation inTab. 1 and similar data occurs in the number of entitiespresent. The similarity index used in step-across is theJaccard one. the number of joint occurrences. Thenatural extension of this to continuous data is illustratedin Fig. 2. It is the total set of joint occurrences. the areaof the intersection of the species graphs. Mathematically.this is Kendall's (1971) circle product. I min (a.b). The effect of using the circle product on species withmoderate overlap is to make them more similar than ifthe Jaccard index is used. so tending to re-create ahorseshoe. This can be corrected by a transformation;the square root of the circle product has been used here.This development of step-across can be called stepalongfor convenience.English (1982) compared MDS. Decorana andstep-along analyses of both the Eastern Wood (Williamson1981) data and a sub-set of the Skokholm data.using years in which complete records exist. Not allvariants of MDS are available at York. but he foundthose that were very expensive in computer time. requiring arbitrary choices of starting point. and the resultsdisappointing. Decorana produced the straightesttime axis. but. as will be seen. the time axis at Skokholmshould be curved. So the method has had the unfortunateeffect of removing. as an artefact. a real feature.The species ordination by Decorana was not readily interpretable.Consequently. the remainder of this paperdeals only with step-along results. The transformationsused here. of square roots for both data and circle product.are not critical.

In 1952 inmixed prairie near Redvers. Saskatchewan. and in 1953in aspen-parkland near Lousana. Alberta (Fig. 1). theUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service undertookyearly collections of waterfowl census and habitat dataon 0.2 km wide. permanently established transects. TheRedvers Waterfowl Study Area was a reversed-L transect.each arm roughly 32.2 km long; the total areawas 12.9 km2. The terrain was gently rolling and reliefgenerally <3 m. The pothole basins were generallysaucer shaped rather than bowl shaped (Stoudt 1971).The Lousana Waterfowl Study Area was a rectangulartransect roughly 16.1 x 6.4 km. or 9.3 km2. The terrainwas knob-and-kettle-like. A larger percentage ofponds at Lousana. compared with Redvers (45 vs.31%). were classified as permanent (Smith 1971).Each pothole on the transects was numbered andvisited several times yearly when breeding pairs of allspecies were counted. Dzubin (1969a) provided a reviewof the potential biases in transect-collected censusdata for ducks. Violations of these assumptionspose problems for deterministic calculations; the valuein these data is that. while they may be crude by thosestandards. the amount of data and the time span theycover outweigh disadvantages imposed by the mannerof data collection. Two assumptions. for purposes ofthis analysis. are important: first. the relative populationsizes of ducks were as the observers recordedthem. and second. proportional use of different pondtypes by different species was represented by the censusdata. The second assumption is made more plausibleby validation of the first; the first is reasonablebecause considerable effort was made to census allponds thoroughly (Smith 1971:14. Stoudt 1971:14). Onebiologist collected most of the data. although in recentyears. other United States Fish and Wildlife Servicepersonnel and I collected data.Each pothole was scored for each of the followingcharacteristics: permanence classification. size.depth. degree of openness of surrounding vegetation.percent coverage of pond surface by emergentvegetation. and type of vegetation. All values of habitatvariables were of ordinal level; type of vegetationwas not a nominal-level variable because it tookon values that corresponded to structural complexity(height. density) of each plant type or association.Twenty-six years of data (1952-1977) from Redverswere available for analysis. Four censuses were conductedyearly from 1952 to 1965; commencement datesof censuses varied between 1-11 May. 1-4 June. 29June-13 July. and 22-26 July. Eight and six censuseswere conducted in the drought years 1961 and 1962.respectively. After 1965. one July census was begunbetween 11 and 23 July; dates of May and June censusesvaried as in previous years. Nine years (1968-1976) of data from the Lousana area were availablefor analysis.

These data provide unique opportunities to test the interactive effects of grazing and climate variables on demographic rates, plantñplant interactions, and population and community dynamics. We provide the following data and data formats: (1) the digitized maps in shapefile format; (2) a tabular version of the entire data set (a table that replaces the full spatial data with one x,y coordinate for each individual perennial plant record); (3) grazing treatment information; (4) an inventory of the years each quadrat was sampled; (5) a species list, containing information on plant growth forms and shapefile geometry type (e.g., points or polygons); (6) a record of changes in species names; (7) daily precipitation and temperature records; and (8) counts of annual plants in the quadrats (annuals were counted, not mapped, by the original mappers).Experimental or sampling design
 a. Design characteristics: 44 permanent quadrats were located in 6 different pasture units.
 b. Permanent plots: We have not been able to relocate the original quadrats because of a lack of permanent markers.
 c. Data collection: Quadrats were mapped annually from 1932 to 1945, with some exceptions (see the quadrat sampling schedule data file in IV). Quadrats were mapped in the late spring-early summer growing season each year (generally between late May and July).
 Research Methods 
 a. Field / laboratory: The data were collected in the field using pantographs (Hill 1920), a mechanical device used to make scale drawings. The original paper maps were first scanned and then stored as TIFF image files. These images were then converted into shapefiles by heads-up digitization in ArcGIS. For a complete digitization protocol, contact Peter Adler. Daily climate data were obtained from the Miles City airport, Wiley Field (800 m a.s.l., 46∞26íN, 105∞53íW) located 9 km north of the study site. For the period beginning in 1933, these data are available on-line from the National Climate Data Center at www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwDI~StnSrch~StnID~20012408.
 b. Instrumentation: Pantographs, scanners, and computers running ArcGIS, Python, and R.
 c. Taxonomy and systematics: Originally assigned plant names were corrected for synonyms based on the USDA Plants Database (http://plants.usda.gov/). We recorded these name changes in the species_name_changes.csv file.

In addition, other territorial behaviour such as courtship feeding, nest building behaviour and copulation was used to delimit the individual territories. Considerable time was spent in searching for nests. Mapping of colourringed individuals was also used to determine the number of territories involved. Each year 13 - 20 census visits were made of which about two thirds took place during the mornings. Each visit lasted about 5 to 5.5 hours and was started alternatively from the eastern and western parts of the area. the census work was coarried out from the last week of May to the end of June. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U-tests Spearman rank correlation (rn where the subscript n denotes df). All tests were two tailed.

Methods for the whole study are provided below and other watersheds are also available within BioTIME.
 
 Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per treatment. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
 Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.

 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie.

 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

Watershed 002c was ungrazed and burned every 2 years. Methods for the whole study are provided below and other watersheds are also available within BioTIME.
 
 Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per treatment. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
 Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.

 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

 Grazed: N20B A:S-24, B:P-2; N01B A:S-25, B:P-23; N04D A:L-28, B:K-28; N04A A:G-25, B:F-26; N01A A:G-19, B:G-21; N20A A:G-20, B:E-19
 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

Watershed 020b was ungrazed and burned every 20 years, and calles 000b from 1982 to 1991. Methods for the whole study are provided below and other watersheds are also available within BioTIME.
 
 Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per treatment. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
 Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.

 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)

Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.

 Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per treatment. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
 Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.
 Grazed: N20B A:S-24, B:P-2; N01B A:S-25, B:P-23; N04D A:L-28, B:K-28; N04A A:G-25, B:F-26; N01A A:G-19, B:G-21; N20A A:G-20, B:E-19
 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

Watershed n20a was bison grazed and burned every 20 years. Methods for the whole study are provided below and other watersheds are also available within BioTIME.
 
 Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per treatment. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
 Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.

 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

Watershed n20b was ungrazed and burned every 20 years from 1980 to 2001 (called n00b), then bison grazed and burned every 20 years since 2002. Methods for the whole study are provided below and other watersheds are also available within BioTIME.
 
 Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per treatment. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
 Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.
 Grazed: N20B A:S-24, B:P-2; N01B A:S-25, B:P-23; N04D A:L-28, B:K-28; N04A A:G-25, B:F-26; N01A A:G-19, B:G-21; N20A A:G-20, B:E-19
 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

Watershed n20b was ungrazed and burned every 20 years from 1980 to 2001 (called n00b), then bison grazed and burned every 20 years since 2002. Methods for the whole study are provided below and other watersheds are also available within BioTIME.
 
 Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per treatment. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
 Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.
 Grazed: N20B A:S-24, B:P-2; N01B A:S-25, B:P-23; N04D A:L-28, B:K-28; N04A A:G-25, B:F-26; N01A A:G-19, B:G-21; N20A A:G-20, B:E-19
 Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
 Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
 Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
 All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
 Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
 Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
 
 *For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

 Summary of All Changes:
 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
 1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
 2018: March 14. 004B ‚Äì A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù schedule.

The twenty ponds were allowed to develop naturallyexcept for scrub control on their perimeters. In the other (Heathfield) ponds emergent plants wereplanted immediately after their construction. The ponds were visited near noon on fine days asoften as possible and the numbers of adult and teneral dragonflies were recorded.

The objective of CWAC isto monitor South Africa's waterbird populations and the conditions of the wetlands which are important forwaterbirds. This is being done by means of a programme of regular mid-summer and mid-winter censuses at alarge number of South African wetlands. Regular six-monthly counts are conducted; however. we do encouragecounters to survey their wetlands on a more regular basis as this provides better data. CWAC currently monitorsover 400 wetlands around the country on a regular basis. and furthermore curates waterbird data for close to600 wetlands.
